# Format rules

This repo uses **Prettier** (the most widely adopted JS/TS formatter) for consistent formatting. Configuration is in the repo root: `.prettierrc.json` and `.prettierignore`.

## Config summary (`.prettierrc.json`)

- **printWidth:** 100
- **tabWidth:** 2
- **semi:** true
- **singleQuote:** false (double quotes for strings)
- **trailingComma:** "es5"

## Commands (run from repo root)

- **Format all in-scope files:** `npm run format` (writes changes).
- **Check formatting only (CI / pre-push):** `npm run format:check` (exits non-zero if any file is not formatted).

## When to format

- Before committing: run `npm run format` to fix formatting, or rely on `format:check` in `npm run check` / `npm run pre-push` and fix any reported files.
- When adding or editing code: keep to the rules above (or run `npm run format` so Prettier applies them).
- CI runs `format:check`; PRs must have formatting passing.

## Scope

Prettier runs on JS, TS, JSON, and other supported files under the repo. Ignored paths (e.g. `node_modules`, lockfiles, `.data`, docs/markdown) are listed in `.prettierignore`.
