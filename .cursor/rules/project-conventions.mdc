# Project: Agentron Studio

Commands run from **repo root** (this directory when cloned).

## Build verification

- After modifying code, run the relevant build: `npm run build:ui` (UI/core/runtime), `npm run build:docs` (apps/docs), or for desktop: `npm run build:ui` then `npm run dist --workspace apps/desktop`.
- Before pushing: run `npm run pre-push` (format check, typecheck, lint, test, build:ui, build:docs, desktop dist). Fix format/typecheck/build failures before considering the change complete. See `format-rules` for formatting.
- If desktop build fails with "file is being used", close Agentron Studio and any Explorer windows showing `apps/desktop/release/`, then retry.

## Lint

- **Fix lint errors by changing code**, not by disabling rules (no `eslint-disable` for errors). Restructure code, fix types, or adjust patterns so the linter is satisfied.
- Use `eslint-disable` only in rare cases when the rule is a clear false positive; then add a one-line comment explaining why. Do not disable to silence real issues.

## Testing

- Run tests: `npm test` or `npm run test:coverage`. When fixing a bug, add or update a test that would have failed before the fix (see `bug-fix-add-tests` rule).
- On test failure: fix the cause and align with business logic first; only relax or remove a test when it no longer reflects valid behavior (see `coverage-and-test-failures` rule).
