description: Agentron Studio repo — build verification and pre-push
alwaysApply: true

# Project: Agentron Studio

Commands run from **repo root** (this directory when cloned).

## Build verification

- After modifying code, run the relevant build: `npm run build:ui` (UI/core/runtime), `npm run build:docs` (apps/docs), or for desktop: `npm run build:ui` then `npm run dist --workspace apps/desktop`.
- Before pushing: run `npm run pre-push` (typecheck, lint, test, build:ui, build:docs, desktop dist). Fix build/typecheck failures before considering the change complete.
- If desktop build fails with "file is being used", close Agentron Studio and any Explorer windows showing `apps/desktop/release/`, then retry.

## Testing

- Run tests: `npm test` or `npm run test:coverage`. When fixing a bug, add or update a test that would have failed before the fix (see `bug-fix-add-tests` rule).
