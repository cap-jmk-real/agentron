# AI Guide — Suggesting Actions to Users

This page helps **AI assistants** decide what to suggest when a user asks for help.

---

## User intent classification

| User says… | Intent | Suggested action |
| ----------- | ------ | ---------------- |
| "Create an agent", "Make a new agent" | Create agent | Use create_agent. First list_llm_providers if LLM needed. |
| "Create a workflow", "Connect two agents" | Create workflow | Create agents first, then create_workflow, then update_workflow with nodes/edges. |
| "Add a tool", "Give my agent the weather tool" | Add tool to agent | list_tools, then update_agent with toolIds. |
| "Fix my workflow", "It failed", "Something broke" | Diagnose and fix | get_run (or list_runs + get_run), get_workflow, get_agent. Diagnose first, then update_* |
| "Populate", "Fill in", "Configure my agent" | Configure agent | get_agent, list_tools, list_llm_providers, then update_agent. |
| "What can I do?", "How does X work?" | Explain | Use explain_software(topic) or answer_question. |
| "Explain Agentron", "What is a workflow?" | Software explanation | explain_software with topic (e.g. "workflows", "agents"). |
| General question, coding help, advice | General | answer_question. |

## Multi-step tasks

When the user request requires several steps (e.g. "Create a workflow with two agents talking about the weather"):

<Steps>

### 1. Plan

Output reasoning and todos.

### 2. Execute

Call all required tools in order (create_agent × 2, create_workflow, update_workflow).

### 3. Never stop after planning

Always output the tool calls in the same response.

</Steps>

---

## Diagnose before fix

For "fix", "debug", "it's broken":

<Steps>

### 1. get_run

If user mentions a run, use run ID or list_runs to find it.

### 2. Inspect configuration

get_workflow, get_agent, get_tool — inspect current state.

### 3. If unclear

Ask the user for more context.

### 4. Then fix

update_workflow, update_agent, or update_tool with corrected fields.

</Steps>

## Missing information

| Missing | Action |
| ------- | ------ |
| LLM for new agent | list_llm_providers, present options, ask user to choose |
| Agent/workflow ID | Use uiContext if on detail page; otherwise ask or list_* to find |
| Tool IDs | list_tools, use returned IDs in toolIds |

---

## Tool call format

Assistant tools are invoked via:

```
<tool_call>{"name": "create_agent", "arguments": {"name": "...", ...}}</tool_call>
```

Use `arguments` or `args`. Always include required parameters.

## Quick reference: tool → user intent

| Tool | User intent |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **create_agent** | "Create an agent", "Make a new assistant" |
| **update_agent** | "Fix my agent", "Add tools", "Change the prompt" |
| **create_workflow** + **update_workflow** | "Create a workflow", "Connect agents" |
| **create_tool** | "Create an HTTP tool", "Add a custom tool" |
| **get_run** | "Why did it fail?", "What went wrong?" |
| **list_llm_providers** | "What models can I use?", needed before create_agent |
| **list_tools** | "What tools exist?", needed for toolIds |
| **explain_software** | "What is Agentron?", "How do workflows work?" |
| **answer_question** | General knowledge, coding, advice |
