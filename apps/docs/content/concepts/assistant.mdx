# Agentron (Chat)

**Agentron** is the built-in **chat assistant**. You talk in natural language; it uses an LLM and **tools** to create, edit, list, and manage agents, workflows, tools, sandboxes, and more. You can say things like *"Create a workflow that runs my weather agent then my summarizer"* and the assistant will call the right tools.

## Where to find it

- **Chat page:** Open **Chat** in the sidebar (or go to `/chat`) for full-screen chat with conversation history, ratings, and settings.
- **Elsewhere:** The chat is available from the main navigation so you can ask for help or run actions from anywhere.

On the chat page you get:

- **Conversation list** — Previous chats; open one to continue or review.
- **Ratings** — Rate assistant replies (e.g. thumbs up/down) to improve future behavior.
- **Settings** — Customize the system prompt and choose which agents, workflows, and tools the assistant can see (context selection).

## How it works

<Steps>

### 1. You send a message

You type in the chat input.

### 2. The assistant receives context

Your message plus **context**: where you are in the UI, relevant RAG chunks (if any), feedback from past runs, and the studio resources you've allowed (agents, workflows, tools, LLM providers).

### 3. The assistant can reply with tool calls

Structured format, e.g. `<tool_call>{"name": "create_agent", "arguments": {...}}</tool_call>`.

### 4. The system runs those tools

Creates an agent, updates a workflow, etc., and sends results back to the assistant.

### 5. The assistant continues or answers

More tool calls in the same or follow-up turns, or a plain-text answer.

</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
  The chat is not just Q&A — it can change your agents, workflows, and tools by calling the same APIs the UI uses.
</Callout>

## How Chat routes (heap)

When the assistant uses **heap mode**, it does not call every tool in one step. A **planner** (one LLM call) first chooses an ordered set of **specialists** (e.g. general, workflow, agent, improvement). Each specialist has a **limited set of tools**; the system runs them in order (or in parallel where allowed) and merges context. So the assistant may route your message to a workflow specialist, then an agent specialist, without exposing the full tool list to a single LLM. This keeps responses focused and within token limits. You don't need to configure this—it's part of how the chat backend works.

See the **[Heap (specialists)](/concepts/heap)** page for an interactive view of the production specialist registry.

## What the assistant can do (tools)

| Category | Tools |
| -------- | ----- |
| **Agents** | list_agents, get_agent, create_agent, update_agent, delete_agent |
| **Workflows** | list_workflows, get_workflow, create_workflow, update_workflow, add_workflow_edges |
| **Tools** | list_tools, get_tool, create_tool, update_tool |
| **LLM** | list_llm_providers |
| **Runs** | list_runs, get_run |
| **Reminders** | create_reminder, list_reminders, cancel_reminder |
| **Other** | create_custom_function, create_sandbox, execute_code, list_files, answer_question, explain_software |
| **Remote** | list_remote_servers, test_remote_connection, save_remote_server |

- **"Create", "edit", "list", "delete"** studio resources → The assistant uses the matching tools.
- **"Remind me in 20 minutes to …", "remind me at 3pm"** → `create_reminder` (message + `at` or `inMinutes`). The reminder appears in the same chat when it fires. Use `list_reminders` / `cancel_reminder` to manage.
- **"Fix", "configure", "populate"** → It uses get_* first, then update_*.
- **General or coding questions** → `answer_question`.
- **Questions about Agentron** (e.g. "What is a workflow?") → `explain_software`.

## Customization

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **Custom system prompt** | Override the default instructions. |
| **Restore standard prompt** | Revert to the built-in prompt. |
| **Context selection** | Choose which agents, workflows, and tools are included so the assistant only suggests or edits what you care about. |
| **Improve from feedback** | Use conversation ratings so the system can suggest prompt improvements over time. |

---

## Reminders

You can ask the assistant to set **one-shot reminders** (e.g. "Remind me in 20 minutes to call John" or "Remind me at 3pm to submit the report"). The assistant uses `create_reminder`; when the time comes, the reminder text is posted into the same chat. See [Reminders](/reminders) for details.

---

## Summary

The chat is your natural-language interface to the studio: describe what you want, and the assistant uses tools to create or change agents, workflows, and tools. Use the **Chat** page for full-screen use, history, ratings, and settings. The run page supports **improving from a run** (retry with optional note so an improver can update agents or workflows).
