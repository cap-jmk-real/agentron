# Heap (specialists)

When the chat uses **heap mode**, a **planner** chooses an ordered set of **specialists**. Each specialist has a limited set of tools (up to 10); the system runs them in order (or in parallel where allowed) and merges context. This keeps responses focused and within token limits.

## Production heap (interactive)

The diagram below shows the **current production heap**: top-level specialists and their delegates. You can pan, zoom, and drag nodes. This snapshot is generated at docs build time from the same registry the app uses.

## Top-level specialists

| Specialist | Purpose |
| ---------- | ------- |
| **general** | Conversation, ask user, format response, remember, list agents/tools |
| **workflow** | Workflows: list, get, create, update, execute, runs, cancel, respond, versions, rollback |
| **agent** | Agents: CRUD, versions, rollback, LLM providers; OpenClaw (send, history, abort) |
| **tools** | Create and improve tools (HTTP, MCP, code); custom functions |
| **improve_run** | Improve current run/session only (no DB); observe run/feedback, session overrides |
| **improve_heap** | Improve the heap (registry, planner); register/update specialists |
| **improve_agents_workflows** | Improve workflow agents and workflows (studio DB); observe runs/feedback, update agents/workflows, training pipeline |

Some specialists **delegate** to sub-specialists (e.g. **agent** → agent_lifecycle, agent_openclaw) so that each node still has at most 10 tools.
