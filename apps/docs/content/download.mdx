## Running the desktop app

<Callout type="important">
  After installing, start the **web UI** first (e.g. `npm run dev:ui` from the project root or a pre-built deployment), then launch the desktop app.
</Callout>

The desktop app connects to the UI at the URL you configure or at **http://localhost:3000** by default. See the [intro](/) for install options.
