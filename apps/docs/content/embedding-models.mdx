# Embedding models and dimensions

When you create an **encoding config** in Knowledge (or Settings), you choose an embedding provider and model. The **dimensions** value must match the model's output size. Use this table to look up dimensions for common models.

| Model name | Dimensions |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| nomic-embed-text | 768 |
| all-minilm | 384 |
| mxbai-embed-large | 1024 |
| text-embedding-3-small | 1536 |
| text-embedding-3-large | 3072 |
| text-embedding-ada-002 | 1536 |

**In the app:** If you use a **local (Ollama)** embedding provider, the model dropdown in Knowledge may show dimensions next to each model name (e.g. `nomic-embed-text (768d)`). Selecting a model can auto-fill dimensions; you can still change the value if needed.

**Ollama:** Pull an embedding model first, e.g. `ollama pull nomic-embed-text`. Dimensions for known models are shown in the app; for others, check the model card or use the value from your provider's documentation.
