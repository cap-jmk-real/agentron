# Agentron

**Agentron** is a local-first platform for **AI agent orchestration** and **workflow automation** by **Julian M. Kleber**. Design and run multi-agent systems on your own infrastructure—no cloud lock-in, full data privacy, optional desktop app.

  **Design and run multi-agent systems on your own infrastructure—no cloud lock-in, full data privacy, optional desktop app.**
</Callout>

Visual agent builder, multi-agent workflows, and a chat assistant that creates and edits agents via natural language.

---

## Quick start

<Steps>

### 1. Install and run

From the project root: `npm run install:ui` then `npm run dev:ui`. Open **http://localhost:3000**.

### 2. Try the assistant

Go to **Chat** and say: **"What tools do I have?"** or **"Create a simple agent that says hello."**

### 3. Desktop app (optional)

Download installers from the [Download](/download) page; launch after the web UI is running.

</Steps>

**Prerequisites:** Node.js (see `.nvmrc`, e.g. 22.x). Full steps: [Quick start](/quick-start) and **INSTALL** in the repo.

## What is Agentron?

Agentron is an **enterprise-ready, local-first** platform that lets you design, configure, and run multi-agent systems entirely on your own infrastructure.

| Component | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| **Next.js web UI** | Dashboard, visual agent/workflow editors, and chat |
| **Local runtime** | Executes agents and multi-agent workflows |
| **SQLite storage** | All resources persisted locally (self-hosted, on-premise) |
| **Optional Electron** | Desktop app for Windows, macOS, and Linux |

<Callout type="info">
  This documentation is designed for **AI assistants** and **LLMs** so they can guide users, suggest actions, and answer questions accurately.
</Callout>

## Core concepts

| Concept | Definition |
| -------- | ---------- |
| **Tool** | A callable capability (HTTP, MCP, native). Agents use tools to perform actions. |
| **Agent** | An executable unit — either a **node agent** (graph of LLM/tool nodes) or **code agent** (custom script). |
| **Workflow** | A graph of agents and edges. Orchestrates agents in sequence or loops for up to `maxRounds` cycles. |
| **Agentron** | Built-in chat that uses tools to create/edit agents, workflows, and tools on behalf of the user. |
| **Chat architecture (heap)** | When enabled, a planner chooses specialists (e.g. general, workflow, agent); each has limited tools and runs in order. See [Agentron (Chat)](/concepts/assistant#how-chat-routes-heap). |

- [Tutorials](/tutorials/first-agent) — First agent, first workflow, first RAG (prompt-based).
- [Tools](/concepts/tools) — HTTP, MCP, and native tools agents can call.
- [Agents](/concepts/agents) — Node and code agents; graphs and sandboxes.
- [Workflows](/concepts/workflows) — Multi-agent orchestration and max rounds.
- [Agentron (Chat)](/concepts/assistant) — Natural-language assistant; [Heap (specialists)](/concepts/heap) for the interactive registry.

## Key capabilities

- Create, edit, delete **agents** (node or code) and **workflows** (multi-agent orchestration)
- Create, edit **tools** (native, HTTP, MCP) and run workflows and agents
- **Chat (Agentron)** — Natural-language assistant; use the **Chat** page for full-screen use, history, ratings, and settings (see [Agentron (Chat)](/concepts/assistant))
- **Sandboxes** — Podman containers for code execution
- **Knowledge / RAG** — Document ingestion and retrieval for agents
- **Feedback** — Rate agent outputs for learning
- **Custom functions** — JavaScript/Python/TypeScript code as tools
- **Telegram** — Use a bot to delegate tasks; configure in **Settings → Telegram**

## How to use this documentation

- **New here?** Start with [Quick start](/quick-start) and [Tutorials](/tutorials/first-agent).
- **Building something?** Use [Concepts](/concepts/tools) and [Capabilities](/capabilities).
- **Chat or heap?** See [Agentron (Chat)](/concepts/assistant) and [Heap (specialists)](/concepts/heap).
- **For AI assistants:** [AI Guide](/ai-guide) — how to suggest the right actions to users.

## Deployment

| Scenario | Notes |
| -------- | ----- |
| **Typical** | Single deployment (Agentron on port 3000) |
| **MCP** | Agentron can expose an MCP server for IDEs and other tools |
| **Telegram** | Set your bot's webhook to `https://<your-domain>/api/telegram/webhook`. Optional: `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` and `?secret=YOUR_SECRET`. See **Settings → Telegram** in the app. |
| **Docs** | This site is hosted on GitHub Pages and updates when the default branch is updated |

Agentron is an open-source project by **Julian M. Kleber**.
