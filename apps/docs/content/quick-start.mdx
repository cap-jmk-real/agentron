# Quick start

Get the app running and try the Agentron assistant with prompts that work out of the box.

---

## 1. Install and run

**Prerequisites:** Node.js (see `.nvmrc` in the repo, e.g. 22.x). Optional: [Podman](https://podman.io/) for code agents and sandboxes.

From the project root:

```bash
npm run install:ui
npm run dev:ui
```

Open **http://localhost:3000**. You should see the Agentron UI.

<Callout type="info">
  For full install (including desktop app): `npm install`. Desktop installers: [Download](/download).
</Callout>

## 2. Try the Agentron assistant

Go to **Chat** in the sidebar (or `/chat`). The assistant can create agents, workflows, and tools via natural language. Try these prompts:

| You say | What happens |
| -------- | ------------- |
| **What tools do I have?** | The assistant lists your tools (e.g. `list_tools`). |
| **List my agents.** | The assistant lists agents (empty at first). |
| **Create a simple agent that says hello.** | The assistant uses `create_agent` with a minimal graph. |
| **Create a workflow with two agents that talk about the weather.** | The assistant creates agents and a workflow connecting them. |

No need to click through the UI—just type what you want. See [Tutorials](/tutorials/first-agent) for more prompt-based walkthroughs.
