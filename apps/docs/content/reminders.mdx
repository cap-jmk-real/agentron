# Reminders

Agentron supports **one-shot reminders** that you create from the chat. When the reminder time is reached, the reminder text is posted into the same chat so you see it when you open that conversation.

---

## Creating reminders in chat

In the chat, you can say:

- **"Remind me in 20 minutes to call John."**
- **"Remind me at 3pm to submit the report."**
- **"Set a reminder for tomorrow at 9am: review the draft."**

The assistant uses the **create_reminder** tool with a **message** and either **at** (ISO 8601 time) or **inMinutes**. Reminders created from the chat are tied to that conversation; when the reminder fires, a message like **"Reminder: Call John"** is added to the same chat.

## Listing and cancelling

| You say… | Action |
| -------- | ------ |
| "What reminders do I have?" / "Show my reminders" | Assistant calls **list_reminders** |
| "Cancel that reminder" | Assistant uses **cancel_reminder** with the id from **list_reminders** |

---

## API

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
| ------ | -------- | ------- |
| **POST** | `/api/reminders` | Create. Body: `{ "message": "…", "at": "2026-02-16T15:00:00Z" }` or `{ "message": "…", "inMinutes": 20 }`. Optional: `conversationId` so the reminder posts into that chat. |
| **GET** | `/api/reminders?status=pending` | List (status: `pending` \| `fired` \| `cancelled`). |
| **GET** | `/api/reminders/:id` | Get one. |
| **DELETE** | `/api/reminders/:id` | Cancel a pending reminder. |
