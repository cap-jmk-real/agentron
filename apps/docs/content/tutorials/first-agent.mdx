# Tutorial: First agent (prompts)

Create an agent by asking the Agentron assistant in natural language. No UI forms—just prompts that work.

---

## Prerequisites

- Agentron running (`npm run dev:ui`, open http://localhost:3000)
- At least one **LLM provider** configured (e.g. **Settings → LLM providers** — OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, or OpenRouter)

---

## Prompts to try

Open **Chat** and send these in order (or adapt them).

### 1. See what you have

- **"What LLM providers do I have?"** — The assistant calls `list_llm_providers` so you know which config to use.
- **"List my tools."** — See built-in and any custom tools (e.g. `std-weather`, `std-fetch-url`).

### 2. Create a simple agent

- **"Create an agent named Hello Agent. It should greet the user. Use my first LLM provider."**

  The assistant will use `create_agent` with a name, description, and a minimal node graph (e.g. input → LLM → output). It will attach an LLM config from `list_llm_providers`.

### 3. Give the agent a tool (optional)

- **"Add the weather tool to my Hello Agent."** (If you have a weather tool, e.g. `std-weather`.)
- Or: **"List tools, then add std-fetch-url to the Hello Agent."**

  The assistant uses `get_agent`, `list_tools`, and `update_agent` with `toolIds`.

### 4. Run or inspect

- **"Run my Hello Agent with input: Say hi."** — The assistant can use the run API or point you to the Runs page.
- **"Show me my Hello Agent."** — `get_agent` and a summary.

## What the assistant did

Behind the scenes, the assistant called tools such as:

- `list_llm_providers` — to pick an LLM
- `create_agent` — with `name`, `description`, `llmConfigId`, `graphNodes`, `graphEdges`
- `list_tools` / `get_agent` / `update_agent` — to add tools

You can do the same via the **Agents** UI; the chat is another way in.
