# Tutorial: First RAG (prompts)

Add a **knowledge collection**, ingest a document, and use it from the Agentron assistant or from an agent.

---

## Prerequisites

- Agentron running
- An **embedding provider** configured (e.g. **Settings → Embedding** — Ollama, OpenAI, or OpenRouter)
- A small document (e.g. a text file or a URL the assistant can fetch)

---

## Prompts to try

Open **Chat** and use the assistant where possible; some steps are easier in the **Knowledge** UI.

### 1. Create a collection (often via UI)

- In the app: go to **Knowledge**, create a new **collection** (e.g. "Docs"). Choose encoding and embedding provider.
- Or ask in chat: **"How do I create a RAG collection?"** — The assistant can explain and point you to Knowledge.

### 2. Add a document

- In **Knowledge**: open your collection, add a document (upload a file or paste text / URL depending on your setup).
- Or in chat: **"Add this to my Docs collection: [paste a short paragraph]."** — If the assistant has a tool or path to ingest text, it will use it.

### 3. Use knowledge in chat

- **"Using my Docs collection, what does it say about X?"** — The assistant can use RAG retrieval (if enabled for chat) and answer from the ingested content.
- **"Search my knowledge for 'Y'."** — Same idea; the assistant retrieves and summarizes.

### 4. Attach collection to an agent (via UI)

- In **Agents**: edit an agent and set **RAG collection** to your collection. Runs of that agent can then use the collection for retrieval.

## What’s going on

- **Collections** hold documents that are chunked and embedded.
- **Embedding provider** (Settings → Embedding) turns text into vectors.
- **Chat** and **agents** can query the collection so answers are grounded in your data.

For full setup (encoding, vector store, document store), see the **Knowledge** section in the app and any **Guides** on RAG when added.
