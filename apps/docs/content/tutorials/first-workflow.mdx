# Tutorial: First workflow (prompts)

Create a workflow that connects two agents by asking the Agentron assistant. No graph editor required—just prompts.

---

## Prerequisites

- Agentron running and at least one LLM provider configured
- Either two existing agents, or be ready to create them via chat (see [First agent](/tutorials/first-agent))

---

## Prompts to try

Open **Chat** and send these (or adapt).

### 1. Create two agents (if you don’t have them)

- **"Create an agent named Researcher that uses the first LLM provider and can fetch URLs."**
- **"Create an agent named Summarizer that uses the first LLM provider and summarizes text."**

  The assistant uses `create_agent` (and optionally `list_tools` / `update_agent` for tools like `std-fetch-url`).

### 2. Create the workflow

- **"Create a workflow named Research then Summarize. Add the Researcher agent and the Summarizer agent, and connect them in that order. Set max rounds to 2."**

  The assistant will:
  - `create_workflow` with a name
  - `update_workflow` with `nodes` (two agent nodes) and `edges` (Researcher → Summarizer)
  - set `maxRounds` so the run doesn’t loop forever

### 3. Run the workflow

- **"Run the Research then Summarize workflow with input: Summarize the content of https://example.com."**

  The assistant can trigger execution (e.g. via `execute_workflow` or by pointing you to the workflow’s Run button). You can check **Runs** for output and logs.

### 4. Inspect or fix

- **"Show me my Research then Summarize workflow."** — `get_workflow`
- **"The last run failed. What went wrong?"** — The assistant uses `list_runs`, `get_run`, and optionally `get_workflow` / `get_agent` to diagnose (see [AI Guide: diagnose before fix](/ai-guide#diagnose-before-fix)).

## What the assistant did

- `create_workflow` — empty workflow with a name
- `update_workflow` — `nodes` (type `agent`, `config.agentId`), `edges` (source → target), `maxRounds`
- `execute_workflow` — run with input
