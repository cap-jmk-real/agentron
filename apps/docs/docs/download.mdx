# Download Agentron

Get the **desktop app** for Windows, macOS, or Linux. The picker below detects your platform; builds are produced from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/cap-jmk-real/agentron/releases) when we tag a version (e.g. `v0.1.0`).

## Running the desktop app

After installing, start the **web UI** (e.g. `npm run dev:ui` from the project root or a pre-built deployment), then launch the desktop app. It connects to the UI at the URL you configure or at `http://localhost:3000` by default. See the [intro](/) page for install options.

## Other ways to run

- **Web only**: Clone the repo and run `npm run install:ui` then `npm run dev:ui` — no desktop app required.
- **Docs**: This site is hosted on GitHub Pages and updates on every push to the default branch.
