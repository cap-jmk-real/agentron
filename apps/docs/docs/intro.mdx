# Agentron

> **Design and run multi-agent systems on your own infrastructure—no cloud lock-in, full data privacy, optional desktop app.**

Local-first platform for **AI agent orchestration** and **workflow automation**. Visual agent builder, multi-agent workflows, and a chat assistant that creates and edits agents via natural language.

</div>

## What is Agentron?

Agentron is an **enterprise-ready, local-first** platform that lets you design, configure, and run multi-agent systems entirely on your own infrastructure. It consists of:

- **Next.js web UI** — Dashboard, visual agent/workflow editors, and chat
- **Local runtime** — Executes agents and multi-agent workflows
- **SQLite storage** — All resources persisted locally (self-hosted, on-premise)
- **Optional Electron wrapper** — Desktop app for Windows, macOS, and Linux

This documentation is designed for **AI assistants** and **LLMs** so they can guide users, suggest actions, and answer questions accurately.

## Core concepts

| Concept | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| **Tool** | A callable capability (HTTP, MCP, native). Agents use tools to perform actions. |
| **Agent** | An executable unit — either a **node agent** (graph of LLM/tool nodes) or **code agent** (custom script). |
| **Workflow** | A graph of agents and edges. Orchestrates agents in sequence or loops for up to `maxRounds` cycles. |
| **Agentron** | Built-in chat that uses tools to create/edit agents, workflows, and tools on behalf of the user. |

## Key capabilities

- Create, edit, delete **agents** (node or code) and **workflows** (multi-agent orchestration)
- Create, edit **tools** (native, HTTP, MCP) and run workflows and agents
- **Chat (Agentron)** — Natural-language assistant that creates and edits agents, workflows, and tools via tool calls; use the **Chat** page for full-screen use, history, ratings, and settings (see [Agentron (Chat)](/concepts/assistant))
- **Sandboxes** — Podman containers for code execution
- **Knowledge / RAG** — Document ingestion and retrieval for agents
- **Feedback** — Rate agent outputs for learning
- **Custom functions** — JavaScript/Python/TypeScript code as tools
- **Telegram** — Use a bot to delegate tasks and reply from Telegram; same as in-app chat. Configure in **Settings → Telegram** (token, webhook URL, optional notification chat for “Agent needs your input”).

## Quick start

<ol className="quick-start-steps">
  <li>
    <strong>Install dependencies</strong><br />
    <code>npm run install:ui</code> (UI only) or <code>npm install</code> (full, including desktop)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Run the app</strong><br />
    <code>npm run dev:ui</code> then open <code>http://localhost:3000</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Desktop app (optional)</strong><br />
    Download installers from the [Download](/download) page; launch after the web UI is running.
  </li>
</ol>

Prerequisites: Node.js version in `.nvmrc` (e.g. 22.x). Full steps and troubleshooting: **INSTALL** in the repo.

## How to use this documentation

When a user asks "what can I do?", "how do I create an agent?", "fix my workflow", or similar:

1. **Concept pages** — Understand tools, agents, workflows, and the assistant
2. **Capabilities** — See the full feature matrix and available actions
3. **AI Guide** — Decision tree for suggesting actions to users

## Deployment

- **Typical**: Single deployment (Agentron on port 3000)
- **MCP**: Agentron can expose an MCP server for IDEs and other tools
- **Telegram**: To receive messages from Telegram, set your bot’s webhook to `https://<your-domain>/api/telegram/webhook`. Optional: set `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in the environment and add `?secret=YOUR_SECRET` to the webhook URL. See **Settings → Telegram** in the app for the exact URL and steps.
- **Docs**: This site is hosted on GitHub Pages and updates automatically when the default branch is updated
