 * Force the React Flow "interactive nodes" bug so it reliably reproduces.
 * Import this in layout.tsx AFTER globals.css to override any other CSS.
 * Remove the import when you no longer need to reproduce the bug.
 *
 * Bug: viewport and nodes have pointer-events: none; viewport-portal blocks.
 * Result: clicks on buttons/inputs inside nodes do nothing or start panning.
